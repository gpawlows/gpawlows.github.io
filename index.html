  <p>My name is Geoff Pawlowski and I was born in Manassas, VA sometime a little over 40 years ago!  
    I have a mother, father, and brother who I all love dearly and miss on a regular basis because they
    still live in the Northern Virginia suburbs.  I grew up in Virginia and vent to college at Virginia 
    Tech where I made many friendships that I still carry with me today
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>These days, I live with my wife, Jeanette, my two daughters, Lucy and Emme, and our pet dog, Tileh in sunny 
    San Diego, CA.  
    I work full time, go to school at night, and parent quite a bit in between, so that doesn't leave 
    much time for hobbies right now!  One day, I hope to get back to hiking more often and seeing if 
    I can shoot in the 80's on the golf course again:)
